# Unisys - Mississippi Child Care Provider Search Prototype
## Documentation
### Brief Description of the Project

The purpose of the Mississippi Child Care Provider Search project is to provide an online search tool for case workers and parents to easily locate child care providers throughout the state. In the development of this prototype, we used the U.S. Digital Services Playbook to guide us; [details can be found here](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Adherence-to-U.S.-Digital-Services-Playbook). In addition to our participation in the Case Worker Web Conference, the project team utilized the Unisys 'Interfaces' design framework for this prototype. At a high level, our design approach incorporated the following steps:

* Conducted qualitative research via focus groups, individual interviews and observations comprised of Mississippi residents in an effort to understand needs gather a wide-ranging span of ideas. 
* Conducted quantitative research using surveys and telephone interviews to quantify attitudes and opinions in effort to formulate features to be considered in the design of the search page.
* Created an initial user interface documented as wireframes.  
* Identified user stories to form the initial product backlog. 
* Developed the fully interactive prototype of the web/mobile application.

#Research and Discovery
The Unisys Team worked with prospective parents in Mississippi to understand how a web search portal could help them find child care providers for their children more effectively and efficiently. We identified the prospective end useres by soliciting volunteers through several charitable organizations that serve parents likely to be eligible for subsidized child care.  Additionally, we participated in the Q&A session organized by the procurement committee to better understand the needs of caseworkers who use the search portal to find child care for children in the custody of the State. Â Our research findings are documented [here](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/blob/master/Assets/Survey_Data.pdf). 

##### Understanding of User Needs
We employed our Human-Centered Design (HCD), 'Interfaces' to elicit user requirements to form the Product Backlog. The section below summarizes our HCD process for the prototype. [Details here](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Human-Centered-Design-Process)

##### Human-Centered Design

[Our HCD process](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Human-Centered-Design-Process) leveraged the following techniques:

<a Name="Inspiration">

##### Inspiration

</a>
* Developed **Design Challenge**: "*As a caseworker or parent, I would like to search for child care providers in my vicinity so that I can choose the best provider for a child*"
* Conducted group and one on one interviews with real case workers (Case Worker Web Conference) and several Mississippi residents.
* Conducted user research [(see here)](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/blob/master/Assets/Survey_Data.pdf) to identify target audiences
* Developed personas
* Brainstormed, starting with the "Diverge" step to get all ideas (no concern for viability/feasibility), then executed the "Converged" step to reduce ideas list to only viable/feasible.

##### Ideation
* Synthesized insights from users (wants):
	* Simple / Intuitive
	* Trustworthy
	* Case worker / children photos
	* Print time-stamped case worker conversations  
* Created [User Stories](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/tree/master/stories)

# Design
As a result of the research and discovery phase of the project, the Unisys Team created a number of artifacts that were used to facilitate further conversations with the end users as we designed and developed the prototype using an iterative and agile approach. Our design artifacts are listed below.

* Developed [Balsamiq low-fi interactive prototypes](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/tree/master/Low%20Fidelity%20mockups) - feedback from internal / user testing
* Met with end users multiple times during development to test prototypes and gather their feedback both in person and electronically
* Developed [JustInMind high-fi interactive and responsive web mockup prototype](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/tree/master/hi-fi%20mockups) - To get early feedback on styling, placement of interaction elements and readability. 
* Conducted mockup prototype user tests; gathered feedback
* Developed live [Design Style Guide (DSG)](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/blob/master/designs/DesignStyleGuide.htm) using bootstrap/CSS/HTML. DSG elements leveraged HTML mockup / user testing feedback
* Conducted responsive design testing on desktop (Mac, PC) and mobile devices (iOS, Android)
* Updated DSG Design elements as prototype was elaborated â keeping DSG and prototype pages consistent and synchronized
* Developed prototype HTML using HTML mockup, user testing feedback, and DSG
* Iterated on pages, incorporating user testing feedback during iteration, finally reaching minimal viable product (MVP) 

## Prototype Development
For the development of the Mississippi Vendor Challenge, the Unisys team leveraged the Agile development process to facilitate collaboration amongst the team and to incorporate end user feedback on a frequent basis. We created our prototype to work on multiple devices (e.g. desktops, tablets, smart phones) using a responsive design. Our [architecture](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Application-Architecture)  is based on HTML5, JavaScript (Angular.js) with a Java API (Dropwizard), Apache Tomcat 8.0 and mySQL database. We leveraged modern open source technologies everywhere; please see below for additional detail.

### Modern Open Source Technologies
The Unisys team chose the following technologies for our Architecture for the Mississippi Vendor Challenge. We selected these tools for three reasons:

1. Our team was familiar with these frameworks, libraries and components from work on previous engagements
2. We prioritized the selection of open source tools over commericial products
3. They provided the functions we needed in order to complete the challenge; For example, we leverage bootstrap for front-end development to complete a fully responsive design

### Deployment Documentation
We deployed our prototype on a public Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. AWS is a FedRAMP-certified Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  hosting provider. It provides us the ability to easily manage the configuration of the prototype and monitor the deployment in real-time. Additionally, it will automatically alert us of any issues. Please see the [Deployment Documentation](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Deployment-Documentation) for additonal details.

### Automated Unit Testing
The Unisys team leverage tools to create automated unit and functional testing. The Unit Testing code coverage was nearly 100% and the evidence can be found in our codebase. Please refer to the GitHub Repositories Page [here]https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/GitHub-Repositories for further details. For front-end and back-end automated unit testing, we use JUnit 4 (License : Eclipse Public License 1.0).

In addition automated unit testing, we also automated functional testing. Our functional testing coverage is documented in the [Suggested Testing Workflow](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Suggested-Testing-Workflow). We leverage Selenium v2.53 (License : The Apache Software License, Version 2.0) for front-end testing and JUnit 4 (License : Eclipse Public License 1.0) for back-end testing.

Finally, the team conducted guerilla testing to identify any defects not found by automated testing.

### Continuous Integration & Deployment
The Unisys team implemented Jenkins inside VMWare for automated build, unit testing, code quality check, functional testing and deployment to both our internal QA environments and the AWS production environment. The builds are executed as code is checked into GitHub. We leverage the following tools as part of our continuous integration process:

* Configuration Management - GitHub
* Continuous Integration Automation - Jenkins 
* Build
	* Front end â Maven 3.1.1 (License : Apache License Version 2.0)
	* Back end â Maven 3.1.1 (License : Apache License Version 2.0)
* Deploy
  - Server â AWS EC2 
  - Developer/QA â VMWare
