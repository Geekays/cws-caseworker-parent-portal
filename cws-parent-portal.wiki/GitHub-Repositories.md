In order to easily run separate continuous integration pipelines for the front end and backend components along with storing Docker containers, our development efforts utilized three separate GitHub repositories. In order to comply with RFI requirements, final application code and supporting documentation were consolidated into a single GitHub repository:

[Prototype Submitted Repository](https://github.com/taborda-cws-prototype/cws-parent-portal/)

Should the ADPQ evaluation team be interested in reviewing the revision history of the application components, we have included URL to the repositories that were integrated into our continuous integration automation below:

[Front End GitHub Repository](https://github.com/taborda-cws-prototype/cws-parent-portal-ui)

[API GitHub Repository](https://github.com/taborda-cws-prototype/cws-parent-portal-api)

[Docker Containers Repository](https://github.com/taborda-cws-prototype/docker)
